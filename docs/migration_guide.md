#  $${\color{yellow} \text{2.6.0 - ESP-Hosted Slave OTA}}$$


## Migration needed from versions

| Slave version | Host version |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| > 2.5.X      | > 2.5.X     |

## Reason for change

1. The existing `esp_hosted_slave_ota()` API was restrictive, supporting only HTTP-based OTA updates.
   The OTA APIs are now exposed so developers can implement their own OTA mechanisms.
2. The port layer previously contained OTA logic, which forced inclusion of the HTTP client in the host codebase even when not required.

## Changes required on host

If you are migrating from the old `esp_hosted_slave_ota()` function, update your code as follows.

### Old API (deprecated)

```c
#include "esp_hosted.h"

const char *image_url = "http://example.com/network_adapter.bin";
esp_err_t ret = esp_hosted_slave_ota(image_url);
if (ret == ESP_OK) {
    printf("OTA update failed[%d]\n", ret);
}
```

## New APIs

The slave OTA process is now performed using the following APIs.

### `esp_hosted_slave_ota_begin()`

```c
esp_err_t esp_hosted_slave_ota_begin(void);
```

Initializes the OTA process on the slave.

* Arguments: None
* Returns: `ESP_OK` on success, or an error code on failure
* What it does:

  * Prepares the slave for firmware reception
  * Allocates OTA buffers
  * Sets up the OTA partition on the slave

### `esp_hosted_slave_ota_write()`

```c
esp_err_t esp_hosted_slave_ota_write(const void *data, size_t size);
```

Sends firmware data chunks to the slave.

* Arguments:

  * `data`: Pointer to firmware data chunk
  * `size`: Size of the data chunk (typically 1400–1500 bytes)
* Returns: `ESP_OK` on success, or an error code on failure
* What it does:

  * Transmits firmware data over ESP-Hosted transport (SDIO/SPI/UART)
  * The slave writes data to its OTA partition
  * Can be called multiple times for large firmware images

### `esp_hosted_slave_ota_end()`

```c
esp_err_t esp_hosted_slave_ota_end(void);
```

Finalizes the OTA process.

* Arguments: None
* Returns: `ESP_OK` on success, or an error code on failure
* What it does:

  * Validates the complete firmware image on the slave
  * Calculates and verifies checksums
  * Marks the new firmware as valid but not yet active

### `esp_hosted_slave_ota_activate()`

```c
esp_err_t esp_hosted_slave_ota_activate(void);
```

Activates the newly flashed firmware.

* Arguments: None
* Returns: `ESP_OK` on success, or an error code on failure
* What it does:

  * Switches the slave’s boot partition to the new firmware
  * Triggers slave reboot with the new firmware
  * Note: After this call, the slave restarts with the new firmware

## How to use the new APIs

A dedicated example demonstrates the usage of the new OTA APIs:
[Slave OTA using ESP-Hosted transport](../examples/host_performs_slave_ota/README.md)

> [!TIP]
> The example uses the new ESP-Hosted-MCU Slave OTA APIs.
> You can reuse or customize it for your own OTA workflow.

Example methods supported:

| Method           | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Partition method | Slave firmware binary stored in Host’s partition table (`slave_fw` partition). Requires an extra host partition, but no Wi-Fi connectivity. |
| LittleFS method  | Host partition formatted as LittleFS and stores the slave firmware. Requires an extra host partition, but no Wi-Fi connectivity.            |
| HTTPS method     | Slave firmware binary hosted on an HTTPS server. No extra host partition needed, but requires Wi-Fi connectivity.                           |

# $${\color{yellow} \text{2.5.2 - Bluetooth Controller on Co-Processor Disabled by Default}}$$ 

## Migration needed from versions

| Slave version | Host version |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| > 2.5.1       | > 2.5.1      |

Before v2.5.2, the Bluetooth controller on the co-processor was initialized and enabled by default.
From v2.5.2 onwards, it starts in a disabled state.

## Reason for change

This allows users to modify the Bluetooth MAC address before the controller is initialized, as it can only be changed prior to enabling the controller.

## New APIs

### `esp_hosted_bt_controller_init()`

```c
esp_err_t esp_hosted_bt_controller_init(void);
```

Initializes the Bluetooth controller on the co-processor.

* Arguments: None
* Returns: `ESP_OK` on success, or an error code on failure
* What it does:

  * Allocates and initializes controller resources
  * Prepares the controller for activation

### `esp_hosted_bt_controller_deinit()`

```c
esp_err_t esp_hosted_bt_controller_deinit(bool mem_release);
```

Deinitializes the Bluetooth controller on the co-processor.

* Arguments:

  * `mem_release`: If true, releases controller memory (cannot be reused)
* Returns: `ESP_OK` on success, or an error code on failure
* What it does:

  * Stops the Bluetooth controller
  * Optionally releases memory used by the controller
  * Once released, the controller cannot be reinitialized without reboot

### `esp_hosted_bt_controller_enable()`

```c
esp_err_t esp_hosted_bt_controller_enable(void);
```

Enables the Bluetooth controller on the co-processor.

* Arguments: None
* Returns: `ESP_OK` on success, or an error code on failure
* What it does:

  * Starts the Bluetooth controller task
  * Enables radio and HCI interfaces for Bluetooth operation

### `esp_hosted_bt_controller_disable()`

```c
esp_err_t esp_hosted_bt_controller_disable(void);
```

Disables the Bluetooth controller on the co-processor.

* Arguments: None
* Returns: `ESP_OK` on success, or an error code on failure
* What it does:

  * Gracefully stops the controller
  * Disables the Bluetooth radio
  * Must be called before deinitializing the controller

## Changes required on host

Before starting the Bluetooth stack on the host:

1. Call `esp_hosted_connect_to_slave()` to establish a connection with the slave.
2. (Optional) Set the Bluetooth MAC address using `esp_hosted_iface_mac_addr_set()`.
3. Initialize the Bluetooth controller using `esp_hosted_bt_controller_init()`.
4. Enable the Bluetooth controller using `esp_hosted_bt_controller_enable()`.

See [Initializing the Bluetooth Controller](bluetooth_design.md#31-initializing-the-bluetooth-controller) for more details.

## How to use the new APIs

You can now start the host Bluetooth stack and use Bluetooth as usual.
All ESP-Hosted Bluetooth host examples (NimBLE and BlueDroid) have been updated accordingly.

For an example showing how to change the BT MAC address before starting the controller, refer to:
[BT Controller Example](../examples/host_bt_controller_mac_addr/)
